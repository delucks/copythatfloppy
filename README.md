# mavica

aka `copythatfloppy`

This is a translation of the bash script that I use to copy my Mavica FD-7 pictures off the floppy disks to my Linux computer using an USB floppy disk reader.

Right now it doesn't do much but mount the disk and copy the pictures to the current directory, but I'm planning to add some more useful features that will be described here __later__!
